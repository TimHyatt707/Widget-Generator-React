# React Cryptocurrency Widget Generator
A simple widget generator built in react to build cryptocurrency widgets. All you need to build a widget is simply input the name of a cryptocurrency into the text field and the application will fetch the data for it from worldcoinindex.com and build a widget for you. This project was mainly built so I can practice using the fetch API and web scraping techniques.
## How to use
- Input the name of a crypto (it's case insensitive)
- A widget will appear on the screen
- You can update the data displayed on the widget or delete it
- You can create as many widgets as you like
- Widgets are not saved locally or per session, they are stored in the top-level state of the application
## Future Improvements(when I get around to it)
- More aesthetically pleasing components
- Convert this application into a chrome plugin so you can keep an eye on your investments while web browsing
